<sect>Building
<p>
To build the software, simply run 'make' in the directory you have extracted the 
archive into. The build process should complete with no errors. You will be left 
with the following executables:
<itemize>
<item>flactag - The main application
<item>discid - A test utility to read the disc ID from a CD
</itemize>
<sect>Ripping CDs to FLAC
<p>
I use the following script to rip my CDs to a single FLAC:
<code>
#!/bin/sh

if [ $1 ]
then

        FILENAME="$1-`date +"%Y-%m-%d.%H:%M:%S"`-$$"
        cdrdao read-cd --device /dev/hdc --driver generic-mmc --datafile $FILENAME.bin $FILENAME.toc
        cueconvert $FILENAME.toc $FILENAME.cue
        if nice flac -8 --replay-gain --endian=big --sign=signed --channels=2 --bps=16 --sample-rate=44100 --cuesheet=$FILENAME.cue $FILENAME.bin
        then
                rm -f $FILENAME.bin
                rm -f $FILENAME.toc
                rm -f $FILENAME.cue
        fi
else
        echo "Usage: $0 cdname"
fi
</code>

This script accepts one argument, the 'base' name of the CD you're ripping. The 
current date and time are appended to this base name. You will end up with a 
FLAC file ready to be read by flactag.

<sect>Using flactag
<p>
flactac should be executed from a linux console prompt, giving the path to the 
FLAC file to tag as its only argument as follows

<tt>./flactag /music/Divine\ Comedy/Victory\ For\ The\ Comic\ Muse/Victory\ For\ The\ Comic\ Muse.flac</tt>

(filenames can be quoted if they contain special characters to avoid having to 'escape' these characters).

If the flactag utility does not find information for your CD, a URL will be 
provided to submit information for your CD. Often the MusicBrainz server will 
have information about the tracks and artist, but cannot match this up to your 
CD. In these circumstances, it is simply a matter of 'associating' your CDs 
DiskID with the correct album data on the MusicBrainz server. In other 
instances, you may be required to enter the track and album information into the 
MusicBrainz service. Once you have entered this information, you can re-run 
flactag, and the data should be downloaded from the MusicBrainz server.

If the flactag utility finds information for your CD at the musicbrainz server, 
the application's main window will be shown. This contains three main areas:

<enum>
<item>The 'Albums' window. This will contain a list of albums that match the DiskID 
	 for your FLAC file.

<item>The 'Tracks' window. This contains a list of all the tracks on the currently selected album.

<item>The 'Tags' window. At startup, this will contain a list of the tags currently 
   found in your FLAC file. If there are no tags present, then an empty set 
   appropriate for the album will be displayed. If you make changes to these tags, an 
   asterisk ('*') will be displayed to indicate that this information has been 
   changed.
</enum>
   
The currently active window will be highlighted by the border and window title 
changing colour. To switch between the three windows, press the 'TAB' key. To 
scroll around the active window, use the cursor UP and DOWN keys. Scolling in 
the 'Albums' window will update the information in the 'Tracks' window 
appropriately.

Once the appropriate album has been selected, pressing 'c' will copy the tags 
for that album into the 'Tags' window. These tags can then be saved to the FLAC 
file by pressing the 'w' key.

The application can be exited by pressing the 'q' key.

<sect>Bugs / Limitations / Future Enhancements
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Once changes are written to the FLAC file, there is no way of reverting back to 
the original tags.

<item>There is no way to 'rename' a FLAC file based on its new tags.

<item>flactag should download cover art if available. </itemize> <sect>Problems
