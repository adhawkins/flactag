Building and Installing
-----------------------

Before installing, edit the INSTALLPATH directory in the Makefile to specify the 
install location. Binaries and scripts will be placed in a `bin` directory under 
this path.

To build the software, simply run `*make*` in the directory you have extracted the 
archive into. The build process should complete with no errors. You will be left 
with the following executables:

- *flactag* - The main application
- *discid* - A test utility to read the disc ID from a CD

To install the software and associated scripts, simply run `*make install*`. 
This step will need to be run as `root` if the install is being done outside of 
the user's home directory.

Ripping CDs to FLAC
-------------------

*IMPORTANT: I think I found a bug in `cueconvert` which means that any FLAC 
files generated from CDs that used INDEX marks to separate tracks that didn't 
have any pre-gap would generate invalid disc IDs. I would urge you to use the 
`checkflac` script provided to compare any disks you may have ripped with 
their FLAC files to ensure that the discids match correctly. Included in this 
release is a SED script which will massage the TOC file of a CD to work around 
this problem. Unfortunately, the only way to recover from this is to re-rip the 
CD*

To rip a CD to flac, simply enter `ripflac <basename>` (where basename is 
used as the base name of the FLAC file you will be creating. The CD in the drive
will be ripped, and a FLAC file created containing an embedded CUE sheet.

If the original CD contains data tracks, then the FLAC conversion will fail. 
Should this happen, enter `ripdataflac <basename> <range>` (where basename is 
the same one specified in the first rip attempt, and range is the range of 
tracks to rip (e.g. if the CD has 13 tracks, where track 13 is the data track, 
then the range would be 1-12). 

During the ripping of the data CD, you will be provided with the CUE sheet in an 
editor. You should delete the data track from this CUE sheet file and save it (I 
will try to automate this process at some point).

Both these scripts will compare the calculated discid of the FLAC file with the 
discid of the CD in the drive. If they do not match, a warning will be issued. 

Using flactag 
-------------

Interactive mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If flactac is executed without any options, it will interactively process 
all FLAC files given as arguments.

If the flactag utility does not find information for your CD, a URL will be 
provided to submit information for it. Often the MusicBrainz server will 
have information about the tracks and artist, but cannot match this up to your 
CD. In these circumstances, it is simply a matter of \'associating\' your CD's 
DiskID with the correct album data on the MusicBrainz server. In other 
instances, you may be required to enter the track and album information into the 
MusicBrainz service. Once you have entered this information, you can re-run 
flactag, and the data should be downloaded from the MusicBrainz server.

If the flactag utility finds information for your CD at the musicbrainz server, 
the application's main window will be shown.

image:flactag.jpg[flactag interactive mode]

This contains three main areas:

- The *\'Albums\'* window. This will contain a list of albums that match 
the DiskID for your FLAC file.

- The *\'Tracks\'* window. This contains a list of all the tracks on the 
currently selected album.

- The *\'Tags\'* window. At startup, this will contain a list of the tags 
currently found in your FLAC file. If there are no tags present, then an empty 
set appropriate for the album will be displayed. If you make changes to these 
tags, an asterisk (\'*\') will be displayed to indicate that this information has 
been changed. 

The currently active window will be highlighted by the border and window title 
changing colour. To switch between the three windows, press the *TAB* key. To 
scroll around the active window, use the *cursor UP* and *cursor DOWN* keys (to 
scroll one line at a time) or the *PAGE UP* and *PAGE DOWN* keys (to scroll half 
a page at a time). Scrolling in the *\'Albums\'* window will update the information 
in the *\'Tracks\'* window appropriately.

Once the appropriate album has been selected, pressing *c* will copy the tags 
for that album into the *\'Tags\'* window. These tags can then be saved to the FLAC 
file by pressing the *w* key.

Pressing *r* will rename the file based on the settings in the 
configuration file (~/.flactag - this file is created automatically the first 
time you run *flactag*). Note that this facility uses the tags that are 
actually written to the file, so should generally be performed after the new 
tags have been written. This option will be unavailable if the filename and 
location are already correct.

Pressing *q* will move to the next file specified on the command line. 
If all files have been processed, the application will exit.

Batch mode
~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, flactag can be used in batch mode to automatically check tags, 
write them and rename the file. Care should be taken when using these options.

The following command line options are understood:

- *--discid (-d)* - Display the calculated disc ID for the specified FLAC
file and exit.

- *--submit-url (-s)* - Display the URL used to submit information for this
file to the MusicBrainz service. Use this to submit data for your CD if the 
data returned does not match.

- *--check (-c)* - This option will compare the file's tags against those 
returned from the MusicBrainz service. A message will be displayed indicating 
where the tags match or not.

- *--write (-w)* - This option implies *--check*. If the files tags differ 
from those returned from the MusicBrainz service, the tags will be written to 
the file.

- *--force-write (-f)* - If --write is specified then tags will be written even 
if they appear to match those already in the file.

- *--rename (-r)* - The filename will be compared with that specified by the 
rename rules, and if it doesn't match, the file will be renamed.

- *--overwrite-existing (-o)* - If --rename is specified then flactag will
overwrite existing files when renaming.

Example uses of these options could be as follows (note the use of the find 
option \'-print0\' and the xargs option \'-0\' to handle filenames containing 
spaces):

Report on the tags of all FLAC files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`find /var/spool/music -name "*.flac" -print0 | xargs -0 flactag --check`

Tag and rename all flac files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`find /var/spool/music -name "*.flac" -print0 | xargs -0 flactag --write --rename`

File Renaming Details
---------------------

The following configuration file (~/.flactag) entries affect file renaming:

- *BasePath* - This is the 'root' directory of where your music files 
should be stored. (e.g. /var/spool/music)

- *SingleDiskFileName* - This template is used to rename disks that 
are not part of a multi-disk set.

- *MultiDiskFileName* - This template is used to rename disks that 
are part of a multi-disk set.

- *DirectoryCreatePermissions* - The permissions to be set on any 
directory that is created (e.g. 0755).

The FileName templates can accept the following parameters:

- *%A* - This will be replaced with the artist name

- *%S* - This will be replaced with the artist sort name

- *%T* - This will be replaced with the album title

- *%D* - This will be replaced with the disk number

- *%Y* - This will be replaced with the year

- *%G* - This will be replaced with the genre

- *%1* - This will be replaced with the first character of the artist sort name

If any item is used but does not have a value, then it will be stored as (for 
example) NOGENRE (if the genre tag is empty).

Bugs / Limitations / Future Enhancements
----------------------------------------

- Once changes are written to the FLAC file, there is no way of reverting 
back to the original tags.
